What is Devops?
DevOps is a methodology which Involves practices to bridge the gap of Dev and ops team by using Open source automation build tools.These are the articles which I refered to, formal defination : "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users." The main goal of DEVOPS is to shorten cycle time. Start with the release pipeline. How long does it take to deploy a change of one line of code or configuration.

It enables developers or the operations team to automatically manage, monitor, and facilitate resources instead of manually configuring hardware, software, or operating systems. The process is also called configuration management or scripted infrastructure because the infrastructure configuration is defined in scripts.
